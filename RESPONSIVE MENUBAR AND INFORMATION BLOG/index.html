   <p>The Section-level Image Suggestions feature has been deployed on seven Wikipedias (Portuguese, Russian, Indonesian, Catalan, Hungarian, Finnish and Norwegian Bokmål). The feature recommends images for articles on contributors' watchlists that are a good match for individual sections of those articles.
      Global abuse filters have been enabled on all Wikimedia projects, except English and Japanese Wikipedias (who opted out). This change was made following a global request for comments. [12]
      Special:BlockedExternalDomains is a new tool for administrators to help fight spam. It provides a clearer interface for blocking plain domains (and their subdomains), is more easily searchable, and is faster for the software to process for each edit on the wiki. It does not support regex (for complex cases), nor URL path-matching, nor the MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist, but otherwise it replaces most of the functionalities of the existing MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist. There is a Python script to help migrate all simple domains into this tool, and more feature details, within the tool's documentation. It is available at all wikis except for Meta-wiki, Commons, and Wikidata. [13]
      The WikiEditor extension was updated. It includes some of the most frequently used features of wikitext editing. In the past, many of its messages could only be translated by administrators, but now all regular translators on translatewiki can translate them. Please check the state of WikiEditor localization into your language, and if the "Completion" for your language shows anything less than 100%, please complete the translation. See a more detailed explanation.</p>

   <p>Best practices are an industry-accepted set of guidelines. They represent the most efficient or sensible course of action. These practices standardize the most effective way to achieve a desired outcome. They are usually laid down by either external, regulatory authorities, or they can be established internally by an organization’s management.

      In any industrial or business set-up, best practices are composed of particular methodologies, processes, or techniques. If a company adopts the best practice guidelines, they are likely to meet fewer complications or barriers moving forward. The concept of best practices is used extensively in different fields such as software engineering, project management, or even human resource management.
      
      Regardless if you’re a web developer or a business owner who wants to make sure their website is hitting a high standard, to increase the odds of smooth sailing throughout the web development process, we recommend you follow the steps outlined below.</p>

   <p>The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.[1][2][3][4][5] The Internet of things is an example of Electronics & Communication and Computer Science engineering. "Internet of things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network,[6] and be individually addressable.[7][8]
      The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, and increasingly powerful embedded systems, as well as machine learning.[9] Older fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.[10] In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with "smart home" products, including devices and appliances (lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems[clarification needed], and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.[11]</p>

   <p>In Simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer’s hard drive or local server. Cloud computing is also referred to as Internet-based computing. 
      Cloud Computing Architecture: Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and sub-components required for cloud computing. These components typically refer to:
      Front end(fat client, thin client)
      Back-end platforms(servers, storage)
      Cloud-based delivery and a network(Internet, Intranet, Intercloud).
      Hosting a cloud: There are three layers in cloud computing. Companies use these layers based on the service they provide.

   <p class="post-meta">Published on July 27, 2023 by Alex Chen</p>
   <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.
       Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
       Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
      Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
       Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
      Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.
      End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.</p>

      Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of human beings or animals. AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and Go).[1][2]
      Artificial intelligence, that has emerged as an academic discipline in 1956, went through multiple cycles of unsubstantiated optimism  followed by failures and subsequently losing funds in several AI winters.[8][9][7][10]
      Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment</p>
